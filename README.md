# Data Structures And Algorithms

A repository containing data structure and algorithms problems with the main purpose of practicing OOP in Python. The data_structures folders also contains stacks, queue and dequeue. It will also include [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) in the future.

## Tests
Coming soon...
```
$ python3 -m unittest tests.name_of_the_file
```
## Clone The repository
Since this is a public repo, you can simply click on the green button called `code`, copy and paste the `https` and paste it in your terminal, inside a folder. This might look something like this:
* Create a folder

```
mkdir data_structures_algorithms_folder
```
* Move to that directory

```
cd data_structures_algorithms_folder
```

* Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonGarcia15/UniverseJF.git
```

* Check that everything was cloned perfectly
